                        <div id="description"><p>The key area of Andreas Drosdz research has been the concept of brevity applied to the moving image, and how this would help the viewer regain attention for information that matters. Whether it is a short summary of a happening in the form of video, or moving image invading Facebook, Instagram or Reddit: the growing tendency in (social) media to equip information with short videos is undeniable. Drosdz is interested in finding out how much of the efficiency of mediation is affected by the amount of content: How much communication is necessary? And necessary for whom? For the sender, or the recipient? What defines, what is exceeding the needful, what is unnecessary or what is missing to the needful?</p>

                        <div id="bio"><p>Andreas Drosdz is an artist and designer based between Stuttgart and Rotterdam. Working with moving image and photography his practice explores the metaphysical nature of image making. After working as a communication designer for several years, he completed a Masters in Lens-Based Media at the Piet Zwart Institute where he researched how conciseness of media communication can help viewers regain attention in a world of distraction. This led to Drosdz's current practice which questions the affect of excess information and images on analogue and digital media.</p>
