                        <div id="description"><div><p>“My Hard-Drive Died Along With My Heart” is a book project created by Thomas Walskaar where he explores people's relationship with hard-drives and what emotions people get after their trust is broken. The book contains a collection of online forum and twitter posts on the topic. As a society we always seem to be looking for a new technical solution for knowledge and information storage and for this, we hope there is one magic, final solution that will solve every issue. But easy solutions create their own problems. The perceived view of the stable nature of digital information differs from reality. Problems like old physical formats, lost or non functional machines, companies that go bankrupt, file formats with no support in the future, changing user licenses are just some of the many points of failure. It seems the more technical the technology gets, the more problems it creates.</p>
